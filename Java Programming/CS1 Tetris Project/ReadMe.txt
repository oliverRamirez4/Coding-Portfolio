This is my final project form my Computer Science 1 class in block 3 2022 at Colorado College. We used JavaSwing to build a GUI for the game and implemented the game without using any implementations we found on the internet. It forced us to grow our skills as programmers and truly implement a project from the content we had learned throughout the class. Looking back, there is many things I would have done differently in the code base but it was a great learning experience to gain familiarity with JAVA and become a better programmer.
