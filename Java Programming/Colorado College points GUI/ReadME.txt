At Colorado College students are given 40 points to pick their classes for each semester. They bid these points on the classes they want and spots are given to the students who bid the most points on each class. I found that it was really hard to know how many points were needed to get into a given class so I wanted to build a program that helps students know how many points they will likely need to get into a class. I went to our registrars office and got files of all the previous amounts of points needed to get into a class and used those as my data. The program parses all of these files and stores the data in hash maps for each class. In the GUI each class is shown and when you select a class it tells you the minimum number of points needed to get in from past offerings of each course.

All of the code from this project is in a seperate repository. Below is the link.
